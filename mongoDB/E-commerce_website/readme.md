# 🛒 E-Commerce Backend (Node + Express + MongoDB)

This is a simple e-commerce backend built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. I followed an MVC folder structure to keep things clean and scalable. The current version focuses on product management and supports full CRUD operations, all tested using Thunder Client.

## ✨ Features

- Product CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- MVC architecture (models, controllers, routes, middleware, config)
- MongoDB connection with Mongoose
- Clean and organized project structure
- Error handling and modular code setup
